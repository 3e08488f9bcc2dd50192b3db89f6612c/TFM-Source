# What's this?
- This is transformice server made in python 3. Works perfectly on 3.5 ~ 3.9.7 versios.
Transformice is 2010 french flash-game written in AS3 (Action script 3), where purpose is to get cheese and enter in the hole. The game sources were so popular at 2016-2018 year. Latest game source was made by me, (Version : 1.696) Thanks to lucas about game swf. The project is discontinued.

# How to run the server?
- As I mention you need python 3, and several modules: pymysql, configparser, twisted, lupa, zope.interface, zlib, ast.
- You need also place where to store the database, I use xampp (mysql - localhost/phpmyadmin).  If you get MySQL error, disable the strict mode (sql_mode=NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION).
- After you create db and install all modules, press Controller.py file.
- After that you can create an account or login on it. If you get error about base.py file (which is possible), contact me at discord -> Paranormal Activity#6083
