# How to run the server? (XAMPP, OLDADED, UNSUPPORTED)
- Video Tutorial: https://youtube.com/watch?v=pjvjAnE1Mmc
- As I mention you need python 3, and several modules: pymysql, configparser, twisted, lupa, zope.interface, zlib, ast.
- You need also place where to store the database, I use xampp (mysql - localhost/phpmyadmin).  If you get MySQL error, disable the strict mode (sql_mode=NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION).
- After you create db and install all modules, press Controller.py file.
- After that you can create an account or login on it. If you get error about base.py file (which is possible), contact me at discord -> Paranormal Activity#6083
